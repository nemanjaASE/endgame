# 🎮 Endgame

**Endgame** is a React web application built with Vite. In this game, players need to guess a random word. For every incorrect guess, a programming language is "RIP" (removed from the game).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/endgame.git
cd endgame
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

The application uses React with Vite. Before running the app, install the required packages:

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application

```sh
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5175.
## 🛠️ How It Works

  - A random word is selected for the player to guess.

  - For every incorrect guess, a programming language is eliminated (RIP).

  - The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or all languages are eliminated.
